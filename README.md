# adaptiv network - javascript test

Hi Adaptativ Team, this is the result of my test. I hope you'll find it cute!

You can just on open the `index.html` file in your browser and it should work (tested on Firefox). Also, I prefer using fancy tools like [miniserve](https://github.com/svenstaro/miniserve) in order to have an efficient reloading server.

Have a good day!
